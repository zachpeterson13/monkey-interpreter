# monkey-interpreter
monkey language interpreter from "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball, but written in Rust instead.

This has been a fun learning project for learning rust and how interpreters work. Right now I have abandoned it but I still think it was a good project because I learned a lot. Maybe I'll finish it someday.
